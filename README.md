# VBA-Challenge
The following are the steps I took to complete this challenge:
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year.
Output the following information for each stock:
Ticker symbol
Yearly change from the opening price to the closing price
Percentage change from the opening price to the closing price
Total stock volume
Implement functionality to find the stock with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.
Adjust the VBA script to run on every worksheet (year) at once.
Apply conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
Ensure the script performs consistently on every sheet.
